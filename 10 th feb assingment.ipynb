    "\n",
    "# In Python, there are several modes in which you can open a file. The mode determines what operations can be performed on the file. Here are the most common modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1) 'r': read-only mode. The file can be read but not modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) 'w': write-only mode. If the file exists, it will be truncated (i.e., all existing data will be deleted) and opened for writing. \n",
    "#      If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) 'a': append mode. If the file exists, new data will be written to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4) 'x': exclusive creation mode. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. If the file exists, a FileExistsError will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5) 'b': binary mode. This mode should be used when working with non-text files, such as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6) 't': text mode. This mode is used by default and should be used when working with text files."

    "\n",
    "# 2) It releases system resources. When you open a file, the operating system assigns resources to it, such as memory and CPU time. If you don't close the file, these resources may be tied up and unavailable to other parts of your program or other programs running on your computer.\n",
